# People who have agreed to one of the CLAs and can contribute patches.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Google employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Google holds the copyright.
#
# Names should be added to this file only after verifying that
# the individual or the individual's organization has agreed to
# the appropriate Contributor License Agreement, found here:
#
# https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual
# https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate
#
# The agreement for individuals can be filled out on the web.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on whether the
# individual or corporate CLA was used.
#
# Names should be added to this file as:
#     Name <email address>
#
# Please keep the list sorted.
