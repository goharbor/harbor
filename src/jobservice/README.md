# Job Service

Job service is designed to handle and process the asynchronous background jobs with an easy way. It is built on top of [gocraft/work](https://github.com/gocraft/work) job queue framework with supporting

* Fast and efficient.
* Reliable - don't lose jobs even if your process crashes.
* If a job fails, it will be retried a specified number of times.
* Schedule jobs to happen in the future.
* Enqueue unique jobs so that only one job with a given name/arguments exists in the queue at once.
* Periodically enqueue jobs on a cron-like schedule.

and the following additional capabilities:

* Rest API.
* Execution context.
* More job status: `error`,`success`,`stopped`,`cancelled` and `scheduled`.
* More controllable actions: `stop` and `cancel`.
* Enhanced periodical jobs.
* Status web hook.

## Use cases

With job service, you can:

* Submit a `Generic` job which will be executed immediately if worker resource is available and can be only execute once.
* Submit a `Scheduled` job which will be executed after a specified delay.
* Submit a `Periodic` job which will be repeatedly executed with specified interval.
* Submit job with `unique` flag to make sure no duplicated jobs are executing at the same time.
* Stop a specified job.
* Cancel a specified job.
* Retry a specified job (This should be a failed job and match the retrying criteria).
* Get stats of specified job (no list jobs function).
* Get execution log of specified job (It depends on the logger implementation).
* Check the health status of job service.(No authentication required, it can be used as health check endpoint)

## Architecture

The overall architecture of the job service is shown in the below graph:

![js arch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goharbor/website/master/docs/img/jobservice/js-arch.png)

Components:

* API Server: A go lightweight restful API server to serve the related restful requests.
* Configuration Manager: Responsible for handing the configurations used in job services. Two sources supported: yaml file and env variables.
* Bootstrap: Take the responsibilities to initialize related context and start API server and worker pool. The main start point of job service.
* Controller: The core of job service. Responsible for coordinating the whole flow of job service.
* Job Launcher : Launch the jobs except `Periodic` ones.
* Scheduler: Schedules the `Periodic` jobs.
* Logger: A flexible logger framework. It will catch and write the job execution logs to the configured backends.
* Stats Manager: Maintains the status and stats of jobs as well as status hooks.
* Data Backend: Define storage methods to store the additional info.
* Pool Driver: A interface layer to broke the functions of upstream job queue framework to upper layers.
* Persistent driver: So far, only support `redis`.

Currently, the worker (compute node) and controller (control plane) are packaged in one process. To achieve scalability and HA functionality, multiple nodes can be deployed under a LB layer.

![js deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goharbor/website/master/docs/img/jobservice/js-deploy.png)

As described in above graph, the controller and work pool which are located in different nodes can also talk to each other via a virtual channel - the backend persistent driver. That means the job enqueued by a controller may be selected by other worker pool which is located in another node.

## Programming Model

To let the job service recognize the job, the implementation of job should follow the programming model.

### Job Interface

A valid job must implement the job interface. For the details of each method defined in the job interface, you can refer the comments attached with the method.

```go

// Interface defines the related injection and run entry methods.
type Interface interface {
	// Declare how many times the job can be retried if failed.
	//
	// Return:
	// uint: the failure count allowed. If it is set to 0, then default value 4 is used.
	MaxFails() uint

	// Max currency of the job. Unlike the WorkerPool concurrency, it controls the limit on the number jobs of that type
	// that can be active at one time by within a single redis instance.
	//
	// The default value is 0, which means "no limit on job concurrency".
	MaxCurrency() uint

	// Tell the worker worker if retry the failed job when the fails is
	// still less that the number declared by the method 'MaxFails'.
	//
	// Returns:
	//  true for retry and false for none-retry
	ShouldRetry() bool

	// Indicate whether the parameters of job are valid.
	//
	// Return:
	// error if parameters are not valid. NOTES: If no parameters needed, directly return nil.
	Validate(params Parameters) error

	// Run the business logic here.
	// The related arguments will be injected by the workerpool.
	//
	// ctx Context                   : Job execution context.
	// params map[string]any : parameters with key-pair style for the job execution.
	//
	// Returns:
	//  error if failed to run. NOTES: If job is stopped or cancelled, a specified error should be returned
	//
	Run(ctx Context, params Parameters) error
}
```

Just pay attention, your main logic should be written in the `Run` method.

### Job Context

A job context will be provided when executed the `Run` logic. With this context, you can

* Get a logger handle if you want to output the execution log to the log backends.
* Retrieve the system context reference.
* Get job operation signal if your job supports `stop` and `cancel`.
* Get the `checkin` func to check in message.
* Get properties by key
* Specified to harbor, db connection and all the configurations can be retrieved by context.

### Cancellable Job

To make the job cancellable, some special logic should be coded in the `Run` logic.

First, check the signal at certain execution points,

```go
if cmd, ok := ctx.OPCommand(); ok {}
```

Then, check if it is a `cancel` signal,

```go
if cmd == opm.CtlCommandCancel {}
```

finally, if it is, exit the logic and return the cancel error.

```go
return errs.JobCancelledError()
```

### Stoppable Job

To make the job stoppable, some special logic should be coded in the `Run` logic.

First, check the signal at certain execution points,

```go
if cmd, ok := ctx.OPCommand(); ok {}
```

Then, check if it is a `stop` signal,

```go
if cmd == opm.CtlCommandStop {}
```

finally, if it is, exit the logic and return the cancel error.

```go
return errs.JobStoppedError()
```

### Check In Message

If you want to report more concrete status info, just call the `Checkin` function in the job context like the below code piece shown:

```go
ctx.Checkin("30%")
```

### Job Implementation Sample

Here is a demo job:

```go
// DemoJob is the job to demonstrate the job interface.
type DemoJob struct{}

// MaxFails is implementation of same method in Interface.
func (dj *DemoJob) MaxFails() uint {
	return 3
}

// MaxCurrency is implementation of same method in Interface.
func (dj *DemoJob) MaxCurrency() uint {
	return 1
}

// ShouldRetry ...
func (dj *DemoJob) ShouldRetry() bool {
	return true
}

// Validate is implementation of same method in Interface.
func (dj *DemoJob) Validate(params job.Parameters) error {
	if len(params) == 0 {
		return errors.New("parameters required for replication job")
	}
	name, ok := params["image"]
	if !ok {
		return errors.New("missing parameter 'image'")
	}

	if !strings.HasPrefix(name.(string), "demo") {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected '%s' but got '%s'", "demo *", name)
	}

	return nil
}

// Run the replication logic here.
func (dj *DemoJob) Run(ctx job.Context, params job.Parameters) error {
	logger := ctx.GetLogger()

	defer func() {
		logger.Info("I'm finished, exit!")
		fmt.Println("I'm finished, exit!")
	}()
	fmt.Println("I'm running")
	logger.Info("=======Replication job running=======")
	logger.Infof("params: %#v\n", params)
	logger.Infof("context: %#v\n", ctx)
	if v, ok := ctx.Get("email_from"); ok {
		fmt.Printf("Get prop form context: email_from=%s\n", v)
	}
	if u, err := dao.GetUser(models.User{}); err == nil {
		fmt.Printf("u=%#+v\n", u)
	}

	/*if 1 != 0 {
		return errors.New("I suicide")
	}*/
	// runtime error
	// var runtime_err error = nil
	// fmt.Println(runtime_err.Error())

	logger.Info("check in 30%")
	ctx.Checkin("30%")
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	logger.Warning("check in 60%")
	ctx.Checkin("60%")
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	logger.Debug("check in 100%")
	ctx.Checkin("100%")
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	// HOLD ON FOR A WHILE
	logger.Error("Holding for 20 sec")
	<-time.After(15 * time.Second)
	// logger.Fatal("I'm back, check if I'm stopped/cancelled")

	if cmd, ok := ctx.OPCommand(); ok {
		logger.Infof("cmd=%s\n", cmd)
		fmt.Printf("Receive OP command: %s\n", cmd)
		if cmd == opm.CtlCommandCancel {
			logger.Info("exit for receiving cancel signal")
			return errs.JobCancelledError()
		}

		logger.Info("exit for receiving stop signal")
		return errs.JobStoppedError()
	}

	fmt.Println("I'm close to end")

	return nil
}
```

## Job Execution

Job execution is used to track the jobs which are related to a specified job, like parent and children jobs. If one job has executions, the following two extra properties will be appended to the job stats.

```json
{
      "job": {
          "executions": ["uuid-sub-job"],
          "multiple_executions": true
      }
}
```

For the job execution/sub job, there will be an extra property `upstream_job_id` pointing to id of the upstream (/parent) job.

```json
{
      "job": {
          "upstream_job_id": "parent-id"
      }
}
```

Under that situation, the flag `multiple_executions` will be set to be `true`. The list `executions` will contain all the ids of the executions (/sub jobs).

### General job

Any jobs can launch new jobs through the launch function in the job context. All those jobs will be tracked as sub jobs (executions) of the caller job.

```go

func (j *Job) Run(ctx job.Context, params job.Parameters) error{
    // ...
    subJob, err := ctx.LaunchJob(models.JobRequest{})
    // ...

    return nil
}

```

### Periodic job

The job launched with `Periodic` kind is actually a scheduled job template which will be not run directly. The real running job will be created by cloning the configurations from the job template and run. And then each _periodic job_ will have multiple job executions with independent id and each _job execution_ will link to the `Periodic` job by the `upstream_job_id`.

### Logger

There are two loggers here. One is for job service itself and another one is for the running jobs. Each logger can configure multi logger backends.

Each backend logger is identified by an unique name which will be used in the logger configurations to enable the corresponding loggers. Meanwhile, each backend logger MUST implement the `logger.Interface`. A logger can also support (optional):

* _sweeper_: Sweep the outdated logs. A sweeper MUST implement `sweeper.Interface`
* _getter_: Get the specified log data. A getter MUST implement `getter.Interface`

All the backend loggers SHOULD onboard via the static logger registry.

```go
// knownLoggers is a static logger registry.
// All the implemented loggers (w/ sweeper) should be registered
// with an unique name in this registry. Then they can be used to
// log info.
var knownLoggers = map[string]*Declaration{
	// File logger
	LoggerNameFile: {FileFactory, FileSweeperFactory, FileGetterFactory, false},
	// STD output(both stdout and stderr) logger
	LoggerNameStdOutput: {StdFactory, nil, nil, true},
}
```

So far, only the following two backends are supported:

* **STD_OUTPUT**: Output the log to the std stream (stdout/stderr)
* **DB**: Output the log to the database with the table name `job_log`
* **FILE**: Output the log to the log files
  * sweeper supports
  * getter supports

### Configure loggers

Logger configuration options:

|     Option   |         Description       |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| loggers[x].name | The unique name of the logger backend |
| loggers[x].level| The logger level of the logger backend|
| loggers[x].settings | A hash map to pass extra settings of the logger backend. Depends on the implementation of the backend.|
| loggers[x].sweeper.duration| The duration of the sweeper looping |
| loggers[x].sweeper.settings| A hash map to pass extra settings of the sweeper. Depends on the implementation of sweeper. |

An example:

```yaml
#Loggers
loggers:
  - name: "STD_OUTPUT" # logger backend name, only support "DB", "FILE" and "STD_OUTPUT"
    level: "DEBUG" # INFO/DEBUG/WARNING/ERROR/FATAL
  - name: "FILE"
    level: "DEBUG"
    settings: # Customized settings of logger
      base_dir: "/tmp/job_logs"
    sweeper:
      duration: 1 #days
      settings: # Customized settings of sweeper
        work_dir: "/tmp/job_logs"
  - name: "DB"
    level: "DEBUG"
    sweeper:
      duration: 1 #days
```

#Protocol used to serve
protocol: "https"

#Config certification if use 'https' protocol
https_config:
  cert: "server.crt"
  key: "server.key"

#Server listening port
port: 9443

#Worker pool
worker_pool:
  #Worker concurrency
  workers: 10
  backend: "redis"
  #Additional config if use 'redis' backend
  redis_pool:

## API

### Authorization

As job service is always running in the backend environment, a simple secret auth way is choose now. To call the job service API, the `Authorization` header must be appended.

```go
Authorization : Harbor-Secret <secret>
```

The expected secret is passed to job service by the ENV variable `CORE_SECRET`.

## How to Run

It's easy to run the job service.

* First, compile and build the binary

```go
// under jobservice folder
go build -a -o jobservice
```

* Second, create configuration yaml file and [configure](#configuration) the job service.

* Then, export the secret via ENV variable `CORE_SECRET`.

* Finally, start the service with the following command,

```shell
jobservice -c <config_yaml_file_path>
```

Enjoy it!
