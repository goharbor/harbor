## Getting Started

### Fork Repository

Fork the Harbor repository on GitHub to your personal account.
```sh
#Set golang environment
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/goharbor

#Get code
git clone git@github.com:goharbor/harbor.git
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/goharbor/harbor

#Track repository under your personal account
git config push.default nothing # Anything to avoid pushing to goharbor/harbor by default
git remote rename origin goharbor
git remote add $USER git@github.com:$USER/harbor.git
git fetch $USER

```
**NOTES:** Note that GOPATH can be any directory, the example above uses $HOME/go. Change $USER above to your own GitHub username.

### Build Project

#### Web

Harbor web UI is built based on [Clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) web framework. To setup web UI development environment, please make sure the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) tool is installed first.

|  Harbor  |  Requires Angular  |  Requires Clarity  |

To run the Web UI code, please refer to the UI [start](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/tree/main/src/portal) guideline.

To run the code, please refer to the [build](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/build-customize-contribute/compile-guide/) guideline.

## Contribute Workflow

PR are always welcome, even if they only contain small fixes like typos or a few lines of code. If there will be a significant effort, please document it as an issue and get a discussion going before starting to work on it.

Please submit a PR broken down into small changes bit by bit. A PR consisting of a lot of features and code changes may be hard to review. It is recommended to submit PRs in an incremental fashion.

Note: If you split your pull request to small changes, please make sure any of the changes goes to `main` will not break anything. Otherwise, it can not be merged until this feature complete.

### Fork and clone

Fork the Harbor repository and clone the code to your local workspace. Per Go's [workspace instructions](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces), place Harbor's code on your `GOPATH`. Refer to section [Fork Repository](#fork-repository) for details.

Define a local working directory:
```sh
working_dir=$GOPATH/src/github.com/goharbor
```

Set user to match your github profile name:
```sh
user={your github profile name}
```

Both `$working_dir` and `$user` are mentioned in the figure above.

### Branch
Changes should be made on your own fork in a new branch. The branch should be named  `XXX-description` where XXX is the number of the issue. PR should be rebased on top of `main` without multiple branches mixed into the PR. If your PR do not merge cleanly, use commands listed below to get it up to date.

```sh
#goharbor is the origin upstream

cd $working_dir/harbor
git fetch goharbor
git checkout main
git rebase goharbor/main
```

Branch from the updated `main` branch:

```sh
git checkout -b my_feature main
```

### Develop, Build and Test

Write code on the new branch in your fork. The coding style used in Harbor is suggested by the Golang community. See the [style doc](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) for details.

Try to limit column width to 120 characters for both code and markdown documents such as this one.

As we are enforcing standards set by [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint), please always run golint on source code before committing your changes. If it reports an issue, in general, the preferred action is to fix the code to comply with the linter's recommendation
because golint gives suggestions according to the stylistic conventions listed in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and the [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
```sh
#Install fgt and golint

go install golang.org/x/lint/golint@latest
go install github.com/GeertJohan/fgt@latest

#In the #working_dir/harbor, run

go list ./... | grep -v -E 'tests' | xargs -L1 fgt golint

```

Unit test cases should be added to cover the new code. Unit test framework for backend services is using [go testing](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing). The UI library test framework is built based on [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), please refer to [Angular Testing](https://angular.io/guide/testing) for more details.

Run go test cases:
```sh
#cd #working_dir/src/[package]
go test -v ./...
```

Run UI library test cases:
```sh
#cd #working_dir/src/portal/lib
npm run test
```

To build the code, please refer to [build](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/build-customize-contribute/compile-guide/) guideline.

**Note**: from v2.0, Harbor uses [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) to generate API server from Swagger 2.0 (aka [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)). To add or change the APIs, first update the `api/v2.0/swagger.yaml` file, then run `make gen_apis` to generate the API server, finally, implement or update the API handlers in `src/server/v2.0/handler` package.

As now Harbor uses `controller/manager/dao` programming model, we suggest to use [testify mock](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/mock/doc.go) to test `controller` and `manager`. Harbor integrates [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) to generate mocks for golang interfaces using the testify mock package. To generate mocks for the interface, first add mock config in the `src/.mockery.yaml`, then run `make gen_mocks` to generate mocks.

###  Keep sync with upstream


Once your branch gets out of sync with the goharbor/main branch, use the following commands to update:
```bash
git checkout my_feature
git fetch -a
git rebase goharbor/main

```

Please use `fetch / rebase` (as shown above) instead of `git pull`. `git pull` does a merge, which leaves merge commits. These make the commit history messy and violate the principle that commits ought to be individually understandable and useful (see below). You can also consider changing your `.git/config` file via git config `branch.autoSetupRebase` always to change the behavior of `git pull`.

### Commit

As Harbor has integrated the [DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) check tool, contributors are required to sign off that they adhere to those requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to the commit messages. Git has even provided a `-s` command line option to append that automatically to your commit messages, please use it when you commit your changes.

```bash
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

Commit your changes if they're ready:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -s #-a
git push --force-with-lease $user my_feature
```

The commit message should follow the convention on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message. See [GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues and commits.

To help write conformant commit messages, it is recommended to set up the [git-good-commit](https://github.com/tommarshall/git-good-commit) commit hook. Run this command in the Harbor repo's root directory:

```sh
curl https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tommarshall/git-good-commit@v0.6.1/hook.sh > .git/hooks/commit-msg && chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

### Automated Testing
Once your pull request has been opened, harbor will run two CI pipelines against it.
1. In the travis CI, your source code will be checked via `golint`, `go vet` and `go race` that makes sure the code is readable, safe and correct. Also, all of unit tests will be triggered via `go test` against the pull request. What you need to pay attention to is the travis result and the coverage report.
* If any failure in travis, you need to figure out whether it is introduced by your commits.
* If the coverage dramatic decline, you need to commit unit test to coverage your code.
2. In the drone CI, the E2E test will be triggered against the pull request. Also, the source code will be checked via `gosec`, and the result is stored in google storage for later analysis. The pipeline is about to build and install harbor from source code, then to run four very basic E2E tests to validate the basic functionalities of harbor, like:
* Registry Basic Verification, to validate the image can be pulled and pushed successful.
* Trivy Basic Verification, to validate the image can be scanned successful.
* Notary Basic Verification, to validate the image can be signed successful.
* Ldap Basic Verification, to validate harbor can work in LDAP environment.

### Push and Create PR
When ready for review, push your branch to your fork repository on `github.com`:
```sh
git push --force-with-lease $user my_feature

```

Then visit your fork at https://github.com/$user/harbor and click the `Compare & Pull Request` button next to your `my_feature` branch to create a new pull request (PR). Description of a pull request should refer to all the issues that it addresses. Remember to put a reference to issues (such as `Closes #XXX` and `Fixes #XXX`) in commits so that the issues can be closed when the PR is merged.

Once your pull request has been opened it will be assigned to one or more reviewers. Those reviewers will do a thorough code review, looking for correctness, bugs, opportunities for improvement, documentation and comments, and style.

Commit changes made in response to review comments to the same branch on your fork.

## Reporting issues

It is a great way to contribute to Harbor by reporting an issue. Well-written and complete bug reports are always welcome! Please open an issue on GitHub and follow the template to fill in required information.

Before opening any issue, please look up the existing [issues](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues) to avoid submitting a duplication.
If you find a match, you can "subscribe" to it to get notified on updates. If you have additional helpful information about the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues, always include:

* Version of docker engine and docker-compose
* Configuration files of Harbor
* Log files in /var/log/harbor/

Because the issues are open to the public, when submitting the log and configuration files, be sure to remove any sensitive information, e.g. user name, password, IP address, and company name. You can
replace those parts with "REDACTED" or other strings like "****".

Be sure to include the steps to reproduce the problem if applicable. It can help us understand and fix your issue faster.

## Documenting

Update the documentation if you are creating or changing features. Good documentation is as important as the code itself.

The main location for the documentation is the [website repository](https://github.com/goharbor/website). The images referred to in documents can be placed in `docs/img` in that repo.

Documents are written with Markdown. See [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) for more details.

## Develop and propose new features.
### The following simple process can be used to submit new features or changes to the existing code.

- See if your feature is already being worked on. Check both the [Issues](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues) and the [PRs](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/pulls) in the main Harbor repository as well as the [Community repository](https://github.com/goharbor/community).
- Submit(open PR) the new proposal at [community/proposals/new](https://github.com/goharbor/community/tree/main/proposals/new) using the already existing [template](https://github.com/goharbor/community/blob/main/proposals/TEMPLATE.md)
- The proposal must be labeled as "kind/proposal" - check examples [here](https://github.com/goharbor/community/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Akind%2Fproposal)
- The proposal can be modified and adapted to meet the requirements from the community, other maintainers and contributors. The overall architecture needs to be consistent to avoid duplicate work in the [Roadmap](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki#roadmap).
- Proposal should be discussed at Community meeting [Community Meeting agenda](https://github.com/goharbor/community/wiki/Harbor-Community-Meetings) to be presented to maintainers and contributors.
- When reviewed and approved it can be implemented either by the original submitter or anyone else from the community which we highly encourage, as the project is community driven. Open PRs in the respective repositories with all the necessary code and test changes as described in the current document.
- Once implemented or during the implementation, the PRs are reviewed by maintainers and contributors, following the best practices and methods.
- After merging the new PRs, the proposal must be moved to [community/proposals](https://github.com/goharbor/community/tree/main/proposals) and marked as done!
- You have made Harbor even better, congratulations. Thank you!
