The Harbor team has made available a demo Harbor instance that you can use to experiment with Harbor and test its functionalities.

When using the demo server, please take note of the conditions of use.

## Conditions of Use of the Demo Server ##

 - The demo server is reserved for experimental use only, to allow you to test Harbor functionality. 
 - Do not upload sensitive images to the demo server. 
 - The demo server is not a production environment. The Harbor team is not responsible for any loss of data, functionality, or service that might result from its use.
 - The demo server is cleaned and reset every two days.
 - The demo server only allows you to test user functionalities. You cannot test administrator functionalities. To test administrator functionalities and advanced features, set up a Harbor instance.
 - Do not push images >100MB to the demo server, as it has limited storage capacity.

If you encounter any problems while using the demo server, open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues) or contact the Harbor team on [Slack](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor#community).
