# Create User Accounts in Database Mode
	
In database authentication mode, the Harbor system administrator creates user accounts manually. 

1. Log in to the Harbor interface with an account that has Harbor system administrator privileges.
1. Under **Administration**, go to **Users**.

   ![Create user account](../../img/create_user.png)
1. Click **New User**.
1. Enter information about the new user.

   ![Provide user information](../../img/new_user.png)

   - The username must be unique in the Harbor system
   - The email address is used for password recovery
   - The password must contain at least 8 characters with 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter and 1 numeric character

If users forget their password, there is a **Forgot Password** in the Harbor log in page. To use this feature, you must [configure an email server](../general_settings.md).
