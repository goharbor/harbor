# Schedule Scans

You can set policies to control the vulnerability analysis process. Currently, two options are available:
* **None:** No policy is selected.
* **Daily:** Policy is activated daily. It means an analysis job is scheduled to be executed at the specified time everyday. The scheduled job will scan all the images in Harbor.

**NOTES: Once the scheduled job is executed, the completion time of scanning all images will be updated accordingly. Please be aware that the completion time of the images may be different because the execution of analysis for each image may be carried out at different time.**
