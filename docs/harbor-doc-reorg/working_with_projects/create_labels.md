# Create Labels

Harbor provides two kinds of labels to isolate kinds of resources(only images for now):
* **Global Level Label**: Managed by system administrators and used to manage the images of the whole system. They can be added to images under any projects.
* **Project Level Label**: Managed by project administrators under a project and can only be added to the images of the project.

### Managing global level labels
The system administrators can list, create, update and delete the global level labels under `Administration->Configuration->Labels`:

![manage global level labels](../img/manage_global_level_labels.png)

### Managing project level labels
The project administrators and system administrators can list, create, update and delete the project level labels under `Labels` tab of the project detail page:

![manage project level labels](../img/manage_project_level_labels.png)

### Adding labels to/remove labels from images
Users who have system administrator, project administrator or project developer role can click the `ADD LABELS` button to add labels to or remove labels from images. The label list contains both globel level labels(come first) and project level labels:

### Filtering images by labels
The images can be filtered by labels:
