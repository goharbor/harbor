+
+Redis Sentinel support for [redigo](https://github.com/gomodule/redigo) library.
+
+Documentation
+-------------
+
+- [API Reference](http://godoc.org/github.com/FZambia/sentinel)
+
+Alternative solution
+--------------------
+
+You can alternatively configure Haproxy between your application and Redis to proxy requests to Redis master instance if you only need HA:
+
+```
+listen redis
+    server redis-01 127.0.0.1:6380 check port 6380 check inter 2s weight 1 inter 2s downinter 5s rise 10 fall 2
+    server redis-02 127.0.0.1:6381 check port 6381 check inter 2s weight 1 inter 2s downinter 5s rise 10 fall 2 backup
+    bind *:6379
+    mode tcp
+    option tcpka
+    option tcplog
+    option tcp-check
+    tcp-check send PING\r\n
+    tcp-check expect string +PONG
+    tcp-check send info\ replication\r\n
+    tcp-check expect string role:master
+    tcp-check send QUIT\r\n
+    tcp-check expect string +OK
+    balance roundrobin
+```
+
+This way you don't need to use this library.
