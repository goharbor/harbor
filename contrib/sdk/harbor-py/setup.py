    # Alternatively, if you want to distribute just a my_module.py, uncomment
    # this:
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],

    # List run-time dependencies here.  These will be installed by pip when
    # your project is installed. For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). You can install these using the following syntax,
    # for example:
    # $ pip install -e .[dev,test]
    #extras_require={
    #    'dev': ['check-manifest'],
    #    'test': ['coverage'],
    #},

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.  If using Python 2.6 or less, then these
    # have to be included in MANIFEST.in as well.

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files # noqa
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the

    # pip to create the appropriate form of executable for the target platform.
